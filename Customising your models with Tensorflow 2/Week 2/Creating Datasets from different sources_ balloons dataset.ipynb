We will use the [Balloons dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Balloons) to demonstrate. This dataset is stored in a CSV file, and contains a list of attributes describing instances of a balloon inflation experiment, such as the colour and size of the balloon, the age of the person who performed the attempted inflation, and the way in which they did it. Finally, there is the target column \"Inflated\", which is either `T` for True, or `F` for False, indicating whether or not the person managed to inflate the balloon."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qeJYtJW7E-ld"},"source":["#### Import the data\n","\n","The CSV file for this dataset that is required for this notebook can be downloaded from the following link:\n","\n","https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bKr-kqhHM9DJBggdmhZ2NFsPX9O4aaYO\n","\n","You should store the data in Drive for use in this Colab notebook."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"HxLmUFcgFhGM","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1610468591479,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":27420,"user":{"displayName":"Valentin Gourmet","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GipXSkYHgIA7qUUkUpEqVgy4Uupcf67DVY3NWjUqQ=s64","userId":"13252817155483159617"}},"outputId":"766932bf-64a4-4528-9283-617e199f9274"},"source":["# Run this cell to connect to your Drive folder\n","\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/gdrive')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Mounted at /content/gdrive\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"4ZIyO0ioE1iJ"},"source":["# Load the CSV file into a Dataframe\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","pandas_dataframe = pd.read_csv('./gdrive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Tensorflow Online Course/Customising your models with Tensorflow 2/Week 2/balloon_dataset.csv')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"z7w4Oqm7E1iL","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":195},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1610468691119,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1214,"user":{"displayName":"Valentin Gourmet","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GipXSkYHgIA7qUUkUpEqVgy4Uupcf67DVY3NWjUqQ=s64","userId":"13252817155483159617"}},"outputId":"edfc183c-e7d6-4613-815a-577c8d257bca"},"source":["# Inspect the data\n","\n","pandas_dataframe.head()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Colour</th>\n","      <th>Size</th>\n","      <th>Act</th>\n","      <th>Age</th>\n","      <th>Inflated</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>YELLOW</td>\n","      <td>SMALL</td>\n","      <td>STRETCH</td>\n","      <td>ADULT</td>\n","      <td>T</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>YELLOW</td>\n","      <td>SMALL</td>\n","      <td>STRETCH</td>\n","      <td>ADULT</td>\n","      <td>T</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>YELLOW</td>\n","      <td>SMALL</td>\n","      <td>STRETCH</td>\n","      <td>CHILD</td>\n","      <td>F</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>YELLOW</td>\n","      <td>SMALL</td>\n","      <td>DIP</td>\n","      <td>ADULT</td>\n","      <td>F</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>YELLOW</td>\n","      <td>SMALL</td>\n","      <td>DIP</td>\n","      <td>CHILD</td>\n","      <td>F</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   Colour   Size      Act    Age Inflated\n","0  YELLOW  SMALL  STRETCH  ADULT        T\n","1  YELLOW  SMALL  STRETCH  ADULT        T\n","2  YELLOW  SMALL  STRETCH  CHILD        F\n","3  YELLOW  SMALL      DIP  ADULT        F\n","4  YELLOW  SMALL      DIP  CHILD        F"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":15}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"c6qEWNY7E1iP"},"source":["To convert the DataFrame to a Dataset, we first convert the DataFrame to a dictionary.
