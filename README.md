# Tensorflow-Projects
Various deep learning projects covering all the essential features of Tensorflow.

The notebooks represent the homework assignments of the advanced deep learning course: "Tensorflow 2 for Deep Learning Specialization",
available at: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow2-deeplearning.

The projects cover all the features of Tensorflow 2, such as creating custom models, inspecting their layers, training them on different problems, saving and loading them, etc...

The challenges tackled include image classification, sentiment classification, language translation (english to german), normalising flows, variational autoencoders.
