# Tensorflow-Projects
Various deep learning projects covering all the essential features of Tensorflow.

The notebooks represent the homework assignments of the advanced deep learning course: "Tensorflow 2 for Deep Learning Specialization",
available at: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow2-deeplearning.

So far, 2 of the 3 subcourses have been uploaded, as I am currently doing the last one that covers more advanced theoretical deep learning subjects (Bayesian networks, Bijectors, Variational Autoencoders).
